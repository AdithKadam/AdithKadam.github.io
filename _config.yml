title: Resources for My Data Science Journey
description: I am Adith Kadam Ramesh, a first-year BDA student and a passionate Data Enthusiast currently attending the course BDA594. This page highlights the key resources I am using to strengthen my data science skills. It includes a dataset of interest for practical exploration and the book R for Data Science, which supports my learning in data manipulation, visualization, and modeling using R.
