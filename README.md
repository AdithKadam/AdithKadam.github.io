I have chosen the dataset provided by [FinancialData.net](https://financialdata.net), a platform that offers a RESTful API giving developers access to financial statements, ratios, intraday market data, insider transactions, cryptocurrencies, and alternative data to uncover unique investment opportunities.\
Using Postman, I executed a request to one of the [platformâ€™s RESTful APIs](https://financialdata.net/documentation) to retrieve end-of-day market data. A screenshot of the response is attached.\
