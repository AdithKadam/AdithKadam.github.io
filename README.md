# Dataset and Book of Interest
I have chosen the dataset provided by [FinancialData.net](https://financialdata.net), a platform that offers a RESTful API giving developers access to financial statements, ratios, intraday market data, insider transactions, cryptocurrencies, and alternative data to uncover unique investment opportunities.  

Using Postman, I executed a request to one of the [platformâ€™s RESTful APIs](https://financialdata.net/documentation) to retrieve end-of-day market data. The image below shows the response.

The applications of the dataset are as follows:  
1. **Intraday Strategies:** Create and backtest high-frequency trading algorithms using minute-by-minute price and volume data.  
2. **Historical Backtesting:** Use decades of data to model and improve trading strategies for both long-term and short-term trades.  
3. **Trend Analysis:** Monitor financial performance indicators (such as revenue, EPS, and net income) over time to evaluate financial health.  
4. **Insider & Institutional Activity:** Track institutional changes or insider trading to spot possible bullish or bearish momentum.  
5. **Fintech Platforms:** Create applications for real-time data fundamental dashboards, earnings calendars, and stock screening.  
6. **Notifications & Alerts:** Set up automated notifications in the event of unusual price volatility, significant insider trades, or earnings releases.
