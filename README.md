# Dataset and Book of Interest
## Dataset of Interest
I have chosen the dataset provided by [FinancialData.net](https://financialdata.net), a platform that offers a RESTful API giving developers access to financial statements, ratios, intraday market data, insider transactions, cryptocurrencies, and alternative data to uncover unique investment opportunities.  

Using Postman, I executed a request to one of the [platformâ€™s RESTful APIs](https://financialdata.net/documentation) to retrieve end-of-day market data. The image below shows the response.

The applications of the dataset are as follows:  
1. **Intraday Strategies:** Create and backtest high-frequency trading algorithms using minute-by-minute price and volume data.  
2. **Historical Backtesting:** Use decades of data to model and improve trading strategies for both long-term and short-term trades.  
3. **Trend Analysis:** Monitor financial performance indicators (such as revenue, EPS, and net income) over time to evaluate financial health.  
4. **Insider & Institutional Activity:** Track institutional changes or insider trading to spot possible bullish or bearish momentum.  
5. **Fintech Platforms:** Create applications for real-time data fundamental dashboards, earnings calendars, and stock screening.  
6. **Notifications & Alerts:** Set up automated notifications in the event of unusual price volatility, significant insider trades, or earnings releases.  

## Data Science Book of Interest
[Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://education.rstudio.com/author/garrett/)'s 2017 book [R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) is a seminal work that uses the R programming language to introduce readers to the concepts and procedures of contemporary data science. The tidyverse ecosystem of packages, which offers a logical framework for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, is highlighted in the book. It leads readers through the steps of importing, cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and modeling data while encouraging reproducibility and clarity of analysis. It is organized around the standard data science workflow. The book's hands-on, example-based methodology makes it a useful resource for practitioners looking to implement best practices in data analysis as well as a thorough introduction for novices.

### Why I Am Interested in This Book
I'm interested in R for Data Science because I want to build my skills in R, which I believe will be valuable for a future role in data science. The book walks through the full data science workflow - importing, cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and modeling data. I already have hands-on experience with data wrangling using PySpark at work, so learning how to do the same in R feels like a natural next step. What excites me most is the chance to go further into visualization and modeling, areas that I want to strengthen so I can better analyze data and clearly share insights.
